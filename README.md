## About

This project is to scratch my own itch in generating <https://fizzbuzz.pro>’s
HTML from the source code folder. It has lots of custom business logic in it,
and thus it’s unlikely suitable for a general purpose use. 

At any rate, feel free to use parts of it in your projects.

## Quick Start

* Execute `./hack/generate.sh`.
* Check out the `./dist/` folder.

## Dependencies

* A recent version of [`pygmentize`](https://pygments.org/docs/cmdline/)
* Go runtime.
* That should be mostly it.
