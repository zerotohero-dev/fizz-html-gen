## Valid Parentheses

Given a string s containing just the characters
“(”, “)”, “{”, “}”, “[” and “]”, determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

* Open brackets are closed by the same type of brackets.
* Open brackets are closed in the correct order.

Here are some sample inputs and outputs:

```text
Input: s = "()"
Output: true
```

```text
Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true
```

```text
Input: s = "(]"
Output: false
```
