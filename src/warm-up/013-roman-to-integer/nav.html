## Roman to Integer

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

Assume that **the input is always valid**.

## About Roman Numerals

Roman Numerals are represented by seven different symbols:

`I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D`, and `M`.

For example, `2` is written as II in Roman numeral.
`12` is written as `XII`, which is `X + II`.

The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right.
However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is
written as `IV` because the one is before the five we subtract it making four.
The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`.

There are six instances where subtraction is used:

* `I` can be placed before `V` (`5`) or `X` (`10`) to make
`4` or `9` respectively.
* `X` can be placed before `L` (`50`) or `C` (`100`)
to make `40` or `90` respectively.</li>
* `C` can be placed before `D` (`500`) or `M` (`1000`)
to make `400` or `900` respectively.
