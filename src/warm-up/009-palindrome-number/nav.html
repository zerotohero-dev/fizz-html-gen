## Palindrome Number

Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a **palindrome number**.

An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.
For example, `121` is palindrome while `123` is not.

Here are some sample inputs and outputs:

```text
Input: x = 121
Output: true
```

```text
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it
becomes 121-. Therefore, it is not a palindrome.
```

```text
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. âˆ´ it is not a palindrome.
```

```text
Input: x = -101
Output: false
```

## Constraints

* `-2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1`
