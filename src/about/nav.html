## About [FizzBuzz Pro](https://fizzbuzz.pro/)

**FizzBuzz Pro** is a place that you can see and study *competitive programming*
questions. These kinds of questions are typically asked in Silly Cone Valley
technical interviews.

**FizzBuzz Pro** is almost purely **source code**. Indeed, this very page that you
are reading right now is generated from **Go** source code. That’s why you
see `package main` declarations at the bottom of every page.

## Simplicity Brings Focus

**FizzBuzz Pro** has everything you need and nothing you don’t. That’s also why
it is **damn fast**. An average **FizzBuzz Pro** page loads under a few hundred
milliseconds. This sheer speed of **FizzBuzz Pro** helps you **focus** on the
problem at hand instead of getting distracted and checking your tweets
while the page loads.

## One Language To Rule Them All

When it comes to *competitive programming*, language choice is hardly makes
any different. And in the interviews, you’ll highly likely be given the
opportunity to choose any programming language that you feel comfortable with.

The way the algorithm is implemented matters much more than the language.
That’s why, instead of throwing ten different languages at you,
**FizzBuzz Pro** provides all the questions and answers in a clear and
easy-to-follow **Go** code.

If prefer to choose a different language in your interviews, it’s just a
matter of reading the code, understanding, it, and writing it your own way.

☝️ This is a learning exercise that I highly recommend anyway: Don’t merely
memorize the solutions. Understand them, and implement them in **your own way**.
That’s one of the best ways to learn things. After all, you know how you learn
better than anyone else 😉.

## Clarity over Performance

With **FizzBuzz Pro**…

* You don’t waste time in hunting for the optimum solution in discussion forums.
* You don’t need to wait for a robot *“judge”* to evaluate your source code.
* You don’t have to spend hours trying to make sense of a cryptic-looking code.

The solutions are neatly documented with inline comments. You can copy and paste
the code and try them in your favorite development environment too.

So, off you go. There’s nothing between you and that dreaded whiteboard anymore.

May the source be with you 🦄.

I add new content here almost daily; however, the update frequency also depends
